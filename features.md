# Potential Pharma-Focused Feature Ideas

Docucheck already validates investigation documents against detailed QA checklist items such as descriptions, impact assessments, and CAPA effectiveness. To extend its value in regulated pharmaceutical environments, consider adding:

1. **21 CFR Part 11 / Annex 11 support**
   - Built-in audit trails and electronic signature workflows
   - Enforce role-based access and timestamped document history

2. **ALCOA+ data integrity validation**
   - Checks for attributable, legible, contemporaneous, original, and accurate records
   - Flags edits that lack appropriate metadata or cross-reference

3. **GxP and global regulatory rule packs**
   - Pre-loaded templates for FDA, EMA, and WHO guidelines
   - Context-aware prompts that highlight gaps against GMP and ICH Q10 expectations

4. **Batch record and SOP cross-referencing**
   - Link investigative findings to specific batch numbers, equipment logs, and SOP revisions
   - Automated alert if referenced documents are outdated or mismatched

5. **Pharmacovigilance support**
   - Identify and extract potential adverse events or product complaints
   - Harmonize reporting language for FDA/EMA submissions

6. **Validation protocol coverage**
   - Libraries for IQ/OQ/PQ document structures
   - Checks for completeness of test scripts and acceptance criteria

7. **Training and qualification checks**
   - Validate that personnel mentioned in reports have requisite training records
   - Highlight gaps in investigator qualifications

8. **Risk-based trending and analytics**
   - Deviation severity classification and recurring issue detection
   - Dashboards for CAPA effectiveness across multiple sites

9. **Multilingual and localization capabilities**
   - Support for regional terminology and regulatory translations
   - Automatic detection of non-English content needing translation

10. **Systems integration**
    - Hooks for LIMS, ERP, or EQMS systems for end-to-end traceability
    - Automated ticket creation for CAPA or change control processes
